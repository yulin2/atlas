<![CDATA[<p>
THEY love 4x4s Down Under so Oz was perfect for testing the new Range Rover 
Sport. 
</p>
<p>
The Blue Mountains and the Bathurst Racing Circuit were the venues and 
everyone was impressed, including rugby&#8217;s Lawrence Dallaglio &#8211; a Land Rover 
Global Ambassador &#8211; and our Aborigine guide Gumba Wakka Wakka. 
</p>
<p>
THE original Range Rover Sport was a success, despite being flawed. 
</p>
<p>
Nearly 400,000 have been sold worldwide since 2006. So imagine how many will 
sell when buyers find out how much better the all-new version is. 
</p>
<p>
<i>The new Sport lives up to its name &#8212; Range Rover&#8217;s upstart little brother 
has come of age, big time. </i>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
It is a big SUV capable of outrageous things off-road and storming around a 
race circuit like a sportscar. Its talents have stretched in every 
direction, from head-turning design and limousine luxury to its ability to 
now carry up to seven people in style. And as the starting price is nearly 
&#163;20,000 cheaper than the non-sport Range Rover, it does beg a question. 
</p>
<p>
Who needs its big brother? 
</p>
<p>
The reality is the more stately version will still appeal to those customers 
drawn by the fact it is 4x4 royalty. But I can see BMW, Audi, Mercedes and 
Porsche SUV drivers switching to the more souped-up and sophisticated Sport. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Design boss Gerry McGovern and his team have done brilliantly, transforming 
the boxy old model into a much sleeker, more powerful style. 
</p>
<p>
It has shed 420kg with its lightweight aluminium body, so it is now as nimble 
as the British &amp; Irish Lions&#8217; George North at full pelt. 
</p>
<p>
But it is still two tons of motor &#8212; easy to forget as it handles so well and 
takes corners at unbelievable speeds with more accurate steering. It 
certainly took the Bathurst circuit in its stride. Just how fast you go 
depends on the engine you choose. The three-litre turbo diesel will surely 
be the choice of Brits because of nearly 38mpg and its useful turn of speed 
&#8212; 0-60mph in 7.1secs. It tops out at 130mph. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
A three-litre V6 petrol cuts 0-60mph time to 6.9secs but fuel economy drops to 
26mpg. The monster five-litre V8 reduces 0-60mph to a sportscar-like five 
seconds and a top speed of 150mph. 
</p>
<p>
&#8216;Wade rivers and power through mud&#8217; Only a fuel economy figure of 22mpg &#8212; less 
than twenty if you really hammer the engine &#8212; dampens the V8&#8217;s appeal. 
</p>
<p>
Improvements include more room for rear passengers because, despite its weight 
loss, it&#8217;s a couple of inches longer. Rear passengers also get reclining 
seats and there is more boot space at 784litres. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
For the first time there is the option of seven seats. Everything on board has 
been upgraded in comfort and quality levels &#8212; from business class to 
first-class. The cabin now matches the classic Range Rover but has a sloping 
centre console and a sporty gear lever instead of the rotary dial gear knob. 
</p>
<p>
You get executive toys and luxury close to a Bentley, plus Land Rover&#8217;s All 
Terrain mode that lets you climb mountains, wade rivers and power through 
mud and snow at the click of a dial. 
</p>
<p>
But if you fail to recognise serious changes in condition the Range Sport will 
adapt the suspension and traction by itself. How smart is that? 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s aimed at active types and has options such as a cycle rack. 
</p>
<p>
Just don&#8217;t be like me and go for a mountain bike ride with Lawrence Dallaglio 
&#8212; he&#8217;s mad. 
</p>
<p>
<i>But the former Lions great has the perfect credentials to judge the new 
Range Rover Sport.</i> 
</p>
<p>
A Range Rover Vogue owner for the past ten years, Lawrence had never 
considered a Sport before. But after two days with me putting it through its 
paces in the city, across country and in the Australian wilderness he&#8217;d 
changed his mind and ordered a Sport. 
</p>
<p>
He said: &#8220;I think it&#8217;s an absolutely awesome car. I&#8217;ve been blown away by how 
agile it is. It&#8217;s like a top sportsman with every attribute. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;They have taken all the very best of the Range Rover models and put it into 
this car &#8212; but added to it. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;From driving in the city, the Australian bush and even a race circuit, it has 
done the business wherever we have taken it.&#8221;
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
For me the new Sport is the complete all-rounder with a real touch of class, 
with prices that range from &#163;51,000 to more than &#163;80,000 for the elite 
version. 
</p>
<p>
When I crossed the line at Bathurst I was in no doubt that Range Rover have a 
major new hit on their hands. 
</p>
<p>
Land Rover have taken all the best of the Range Rover and Sport but added an 
extra dimension. It has really impressed me with how capable it is, 
especially its road handling and comfort. It is the ultimate allrounder. 
</p>
<p>
<i>And, just like the Lions, it has taken everything Australia could throw at 
it.</i>

<![CDATA[<p>
LEXUS are trying hard to grab your attention. 
</p>
<p>
Not only are their models getting a radical restyling, their advertising goes 
under the full-on banner Amazing Emotion. 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s quite a turnaround for a car firm previously not very big at all on 
emotion &#8212; Lexus used to be all about superior quality and customer service. 
</p>
<p>
They were a safe, if uninspiring, premium brand that appealed to buyers 
wanting something different without rocking the boat. 
</p>
<p>
It got Lexus established and has seen them clock up 5.6million sales since 
they were set up in 1989 as the luxury arm of Toyota. 
</p>
<p>
Aggressive American buyers fell in love with Lexus but the rest of the world 
has proved tougher to crack. 
</p>
<p>
Lexus sold 45,610 cars in Europe last year &#8212; fewer than the number of 3 Series 
cars BMW shifted in the UK. 
</p>
<p>
In fact, Lexus&#8217;s progress has slowed in recent years, largely because of the 
economic state of Europe. 
</p>
<p>
So they are now looking at reinventing themselves with a much more aggressive, 
style-led range. 
</p>
<p>
They also plan to extend their line-up in the next two years, with a compact 
SUV and a new coupe/cabriolet version of their IS junior executive car. 
</p>
<p>
Here I report on my test-drive of the IS &#8212; Lexus&#8217;s key model for kick-starting 
sales, particularly across Europe. 
</p>
<h4>
ROAD TEST: LEXUS IS 300hF SPORT 
</h4>
<p>
THE original IS summed up the Lexus brand &#8211; a premium alternative to the 
Germans but not quite good enough to beat them. 
</p>
<p>
The all-new version is a far more radical affair, especially the F-Sport 
hybrid I tested. 
</p>
<p>
It gets an in-your-face design that features a gaping double grille flanked by 
sparkling headlights and LED running lights. 
</p>
<p>
The side profile gets sharp crease lines in the doors and rear wing, while a 
ballsy back view dominated by long, slashing, diamond rear lights fills the 
IS with visual interest. 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s a much more imposing look, which now makes the BMW 3 Series, Audi A4 and 
Mercedes C Class look safe and predictable &#8211; like Lexus used to be. The much 
racier feel is carried over into the interior, which takes design cues from 
Lexus&#8217;s LFA supercar. 
</p>
<p>
The cabin has a cockpit flavour, with the easy-to-handle instruments wrapped 
around the driver, who is separated from his passenger by a thick centre 
console. 
</p>
<p>
The interior&#8217;s fit and finish is all top quality, from the lavish leather 
seats to the stylish door trim. 
</p>
<p>
The driving seat position completes the much sportier package as you sit lower 
and cocooned, while the rear passengers are treated to an extra 85mm of leg 
room. Head room is tight for tall adults though. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Lexus are putting their faith in hybrid/petrol engines and offer no diesel 
option, which will be seen by many as a weakness. 
</p>
<p>
But in many ways the 2.5litre petrol/hybrid is a cracker. It&#8217;s stunningly 
refined, quiet as a Rolls-Royce whisper. But it sure packs a punch, with 
178bhp from the petrol engine and a further 141bhp kicking in from the 
electric motor. 
</p>
<p>
You get zero emission in pure electric mode and still just 109g/km of carbon 
emissions &#8211; great for company buyers, as is the economy rating of between 
50mpg and 60mpg. 
</p>
<p>
The only problem is the E-CVT gearbox, which is unresponsive and seems to be 
constantly hunting for gears when you drive it hard. It needs a full auto or 
good manual design, because even using the F1-style paddles fails to improve 
matters. 
</p>
<p>
Yet the IS&#8217;s crisp steering is better than an Audi A4, a match for the Merc 
C-Class and only just pipped by a BMW 3 Series. 
</p>
<p>
In SE trim, the IS300h is only marginally more expensive than a mid-spec 
2litre diesel from Lexus&#8217;s German rivals, but the 300hF Sport pushes the 
price to &#163;33,495. 
</p>
<p>
The IS 300hF Sport is a real alternative to the Germans &#8211; but is likely to 
remain a niche car until Lexus improve the gearbox in the hybrid, or offer a 
good diesel.

<tol-text:story>
<![CDATA[<p>
YOU don&#8217;t think of England footballers driving a Vauxhall Astra &#8211; they&#8217;re more 
likely to be found in a supercar or Range Rover. 
</p>
<p>
Which begs the question: What do Vauxhall get for their four-year deal in 
excess of &#163;20million to sponsor the England team? 
</p>
<p>
And how big a disaster would it be for them if England don&#8217;t make it to next 
year&#8217;s World Cup finals in Brazil? Losers don&#8217;t sell cars. 
</p>
<p>
Vauxhall&#8217;s managing director Duncan Aldred is praying as much as team boss Roy 
Hodgson and thousands of fans that the national side reach the finals. 
</p>
<p>
Aldred is an England fan &#8212; but first and foremost a hard-nosed businessman who 
knows he needs a serious return on his major investment in the side. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
He says the deal is a long-term investment and not dependant on the Three 
Lions getting to Brazil. 
</p>
<p>
But he admits: &#8220;I am desperate the team make it to the World Cup finals.The 
exposure and value of being in a major tournament is a lot higher, the 
awareness is dramatically higher.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
He says: &#8220;Our research shows that car buyers&#8217; awareness of Vauxhall has 
increased by ten per cent and they are more likely to buy a Vauxhall because 
of the sponsorship, which is massive. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;And it shows us the sponsorship works and does help to sell cars &#8212; it has 
lifted the brand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I sat with him watching England in their friendly match against Brazil in the 
Maracana Stadium. He smiled as the Vauxhall name flashed up on billboards in 
front of 80,000 fans and a television audience of millions. 
</p>
<p>
Aldred was equally happy spending the evening with supporters at a Fans&#8217; Zone 
in Rio de Janeiro. 
</p>
<p>
Sponsored by Vauxhall, fans had the chance to meet Sir Trevor Brooking and 
other ex-players such as Danny Mills. 
</p>
<p>
This is part of Vauxhall and the FA&#8217;s plans to give England supporters a 
better deal when they watch the team at Wembley and in far-flung places. 
</p>
<p>
Matches are the high-profile spotlight that mega-bucks sponsorship can shine 
on your brand. 
</p>
<p>
And it goes further than the name on billboards, kit and about 200 cars and 
vans being driven by FA staff. 
</p>
<p>
The sponsorship is being invested by the FA into improving facilities and 
coaching at a national and grassroots level around the country. 
</p>
<p>
Aldred says the sponsorship is a key component in showing the scale of 
ambition Vauxhall have to become the UK&#8217;s top-selling car brand &#8212; and 
preferred choice of the British mainstream car-buying public. 
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s also a great showcase for their most dramatic line-up of new cars in 
their 113-year history. 
</p>
<p>
Aldred says that although there is good awareness of Vauxhall in the UK, many 
potential buyers don&#8217;t realise the major changes made in recent years. 
</p>
<p>
And he believes sponsoring England gives Vauxhall a real connection with the 
British public. 
</p>
<p>
He says: &#8220;We wanted to display our British identity and 113-year heritage of 
making cars in the UK. 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We want to connect with the British public and what better way than 
sponsoring the country&#8217;s football teams? 
</p>
<p>
&#8220;We want to stretch the appeal of the brand and make it aspirational, but 
still affordable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
It&#8217;s not only the senior England squad that Vauxhall sponsor. They support all 
age groups as well as the women&#8217;s teams and the England Disabled Team. 
</p>
<p>
But Aldred is aware that just as a good performance in Brazil would bring a 
feelgood factor, failure to qualify or a poor showing would mean Vauxhall 
being associated with an England flop. 
</p>
<p>
He believes the deal is a great shop window for their new models such as the 
Adam city car, Mokka SUV and Cascada convertible, as well as household names 
like the Astra and Corsa. 
</p>
<p>
He says the sponsorship also gives Vauxhall a link to thousands of young fans 
&#8212; car buyers of the future. 
</p>
<p>
Part of the package gives Vauxhall access to England&#8217;s top players and Wayne 
Rooney, <i>above</i>, is designing his own version of the Adam city car. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
It&#8217;s a clever move that helps illustrate the huge potential to personalise a 
car that is Vauxhall&#8217;s answer to the Mini. 
</p>
<p>
Players also meet Vauxhall dealers, owners and the firm&#8217;s workforce, as well 
as taking coaching sessions. 
</p>
<p>
I saw England coach and former player Gary Neville hold a session at the FA&#8217;s 
training HQ at St George&#8217;s Park near Burton, Staffs. 
</p>
<p>
He met a squad of Under 14 players from Doncaster who are sponsored by a local 
Vauxhall dealer. 
</p>
<p>
Neville says: &#8220;Football at grassroots level is crucially important to 
producing the England players of the future, and these events give us a 
chance to meet and encourage young players.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
Although Neville says he is not a big car fan, he is impressed with his 
electric/hybrid Vauxhall Ampera that runs on electric and a petrol motor. 
</p>
<p>
He says: &#8220;I&#8217;ve had the car a year and only filled it up five times, because 
most of my trips I can run on pure electric. I also like the silence of the 
car because it&#8217;s a very stress-free place to travel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
England players Glen Johnson and Phil Jagielka are also driving Amperas, while 
Hodgson has an Insignia. 
</p>
<p>
Vauxhall are clearly investing heavily and taking a gamble in their England 
sponsorship deal. 
</p>
<p>
They know that football can be a winning formula &#8212; but that success is not 
guaranteed. 
</p>
<p>
<i>Vauxhall also know that England need to deliver on the pitch if they are to 
reap the rewards in their showrooms. Failure does not bear thinking about.</i>
</p>
<h4 align="center">
&#8216;70mpg and no road tax, a real England favourite&#8217;
</h4>
<h4>
ROAD TEST: VAUXHALL CORSA ECOFLEX 
</h4>
<p>
THE only time an England footballer might have owned a Vauxhall Corsa was as 
their first car as an apprentice. 
</p>
<p>
But I think every England player should be forced to drive a Corsa as a 
reality check to remember what life is like in the real world. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
They would be surprised by how good a modern Corsa is, just as I was when I 
tried the latest model. 
</p>
<p>
Despite being one of the older superminis on the block, the Corsa still looks 
good alongside new rivals and it remains consistently in the top three 
best-selling cars in the UK. 
</p>
<p>
The EcoFlex 1.3 turbo diesel I tested offers a double whammy &#8211; super-clean 
88g/km of CO2 emissions, which means no road tax, plus close to 70mpg with a 
light right foot. 
</p>
<p>
The engine is quiet, refined and reasonably nippy for a supermini, all of 
which mean it is ideal for city commuters. And, unlike superminis of the 
past, it is quite capable of coping with a long motorway drive in a degree 
of comfort. 
</p>
<p>
The Corsa is still the UK&#8217;s third-best selling car, and an all-new version is 
due next year. 
</p>
<p>
Corsa prices start at &#163;9,495 and even this EcoFlex at &#163;15,410 is loose change 
for a footballer. 
</p>
<h4 align="center">
&#8216;As menacing as Rooney with a real turn of pace&#8217;
</h4>
<h4>
ROAD TEST: VAUXHALL VXR8 TOURER 
</h4>
<p>
IF one car in the Vauxhall range might appeal to the extravagant motoring 
tastes of England players it would be the VXR8 Tourer. 
</p>
<p>
In fact, I think it would be the perfect wheels for Wayne Rooney &#8211; lots of 
attitude, in your face, but with the ability to perform. 
</p>
<p>
There is nothing subtle about the VXR8 Tourer estate, hardly surprising when 
you consider it is based on an Australian muscle car. 
</p>
<p>
And it looks as menacing as Rooney after he&#8217;d been subbed by Sir Alex 
Ferguson. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
But when you flatten the accelerator the VXR8 is a real firebrand, with a 
thumping 6.2-litre V8 capable of getting close to supercar speeds. 
</p>
<p>
And the engine sounds like thunder as 0-60mph takes only 4.9 seconds, while 
top speed is limited to 155mph. 
</p>
<p>
Economy is not the VXR Tourer&#8217;s strong point. Drive it to the max and it drops 
to around 17mpg. But you can get close to 30mpg if you treat it gently. 
</p>
<p>
For a big, bulky estate it handles well and can be thrown around with a degree 
of confidence &#8211; although the steering is heavy and the gear changes demand a 
firm hand. On the inside, the cabin feels like an Aussie attempt at luxury. 
</p>
<p>
It has all the bells and whistles of similarly- priced European rivals &#8211; but 
not quite the finish you&#8217;d expect from a &#163;50,000 executive car. 
</p>
<p>
It is, though, seriously comfortable. The sports seats are like two big 
armchairs and it is big on space, with a huge boot that could carry all the 
training gear of the modern footballer. 
</p>
<p>
Like certain footballers, the VXR8 Tourer is full of attitude but likely to be 
an acquired taste. 
</p>
<p>
That means it will also be exclusive &#8211; perfect for an England player.

<![CDATA[<p>
NISSAN have become one of the most inventive and bold mainstream car makers in 
the past few years.
</p>
<p>
The Japanese firm have always been willing to take a risk with models such as 
the original Eighties Micra, the 350Z coup&#233; and the GT-R supercar saloon.
</p>
<p>
But in 2006 they went right out on a limb when the totally different Qashqai 
broke the mould of traditional family hatchbacks.
</p>
<p>
Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn said he was tired of &#8220;me too&#8221; lookalike hatchbacks, 
and that the firm&#8217;s Almera replacement would start a new trend.
</p>
<p>
The Qashqai did just that with its unique styling that was a crossover between 
a hatchback and a compact SUV, aimed at family motorists wanting something 
different.
</p>
<p>
The Qashqai was clearly what motorists had been waiting for. 
</p>
<p>
It was an overnight success and now, six years later, is consistently one of 
Britain and Europe&#8217;s favourite cars and has sold nearly 1.6million models.
</p>
<p>
And when the rest of the car industry follow you, as they did with the 
Qashqai, you know your on to a real winner.
</p>
<p>
In the first four months of 2013 the Qashqai&#8217;s popularity remains as strong as 
ever. It&#8217;s the UK&#8217;s sixth best-selling car and has already clocked up nearly 
20,000 sales.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Nissan quickly realised they had found a new motoring niche with the Qashqai 
and followed it up with the even more radical Juke.
</p>
<p>
The impossible-to-ignore Juke was a pumped-up supermini that looked like a 
cross between a baby SUV and a coup&#233;.
</p>
<p>
It was a model that split opinion and still does &#8212; motorists either love or 
loathe the Juke. 
</p>
<p>
Fortunately for Nissan, it&#8217;s more of love affair and sales are closing in on 
400,000 in less than three years.
</p>
<p>
Now Nissan believe they have found another niche to add to the Juke&#8217;s success 
with a feisty new performance Nismo version and, once again, they appear to 
have scored a bull&#8217;s-eye.
</p>
<p>
They planned to sell just 600 in the UK this year but demand has been so 
strong that number has now been increased to 1,000.
</p>
<p>
Both the Juke and Qashqai are built at Nissan&#8217;s Sunderland factory, which is 
currently looking to produce more than 500,000 vehicles this year, making it 
the most productive car plant in Europe.
</p>
<p>
The factory has also just started production of the Leaf &#8212; the bestselling 
all-electric vehicle in the world. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Nissan have also built a plant at Sunderland to supply batteries for the Leaf, 
creating a further 300 jobs.
</p>
<p>
At the moment, production is just 60 a day, small numbers compared with the 
2,185 Qashqais and Jukes rolling off the lines every day. 
</p>
<p>
But Nissan believe electric motoring and the Leaf will play an increasingly 
important role in the long-term future of motoring.
</p>
<p>
And, this summer, the factory gears up to produce an all-new version of the 
Note &#8212; a small car the Japanese firm expect to appeal to British motorists 
in the same way as the Qashqai and Juke.
</p>
<p>
The last Note was a mini people carrier that was more old-school and although 
it sold reasonably, it failed to capture the imagination.
</p>
<p>
Nissan have rethought the idea and made the new Note a direct rival to the 
Fiesta in the supermini class, sitting above their own entry-level Micra, 
with prices expected to start at about &#163;12,000. 
</p>
<p>
And this time they are giving the Note some style to go with its practicality.
</p>
<p>
They are also promising it will be a technology leader for small cars, with 
all the latest connectivity the modern motorist is looking for.
</p>
<p>
Nissan clearly see the Note regaining them lost sales in the supermini sector, 
with the current Micra losing its sparkle and many of the customers that 
made it such a huge favourite with British buyers in the Eighties and 
Nineties.
</p>
<p>
Nissan built more than 2.3million Micras at Sunderland but that took more than 
18 years.
</p>
<p>
We get a first drive of the Note next month and if they have repeated the 
winning formula of the Qashqai and Juke, they could once again have a 
supermini to rival the success of the original Micra.
</p>
<p></p>
<h4>
ROAD TEST: JUKE NISMO
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>
THE Juke has always been the small car that&#8217;s big on attitude.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Now Nissan are giving it performance to match the design attitude by creating 
a Nismo version.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
They see the Nismo range becoming the equivalent of Ford&#8217;s RS and ST, 
Vauxhall&#8217;s VXR and Renault&#8217;s Sport. 
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
You can tell instantly it is the unruly member of the Juke pack &#8211; with a body 
makeover that gives it an extra edge.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The in-your-face front end looks more menacing. It has a black/chrome mesh 
grille and a lower grille with red piping and body skirts &#8211; plus LED running 
lights to let everyone know that you&#8217;re in a Nismo.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Add smoked-grey 18in alloy wheels with wider tyres, extra-flared arches, side 
skirts and a rear spoiler and there&#8217;s no way people won&#8217;t see you coming.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The 1.6litre turbo petrol engine gets an extra 10bhp to give it 187bhp of 
genuine grunt under the bonnet.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
That&#8217;s quick enough to cut 0-62mph to 7.8 seconds, which should be fast enough 
for most Juke drivers.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
And you can still get close to 40mpg driving the Juke around town.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
It&#8217;s not quite serious hot-hatch handling, but it will make you smile.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
On the inside, the Nismo gets a dark and moody treatment.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
But there are flashes of red trim and a red rev counter, drilled metal pedals 
and suede steering wheel that confirm you are driving a special Juke.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Owners will also be able to download a Nismo iPad app, which can store driving 
data and even lap times for the serious go-faster drivers.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Juke prices begin at &#163;14,495 but you pay for the extra Nismo clout.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
They start off at &#163;19,999 &#8211; and rise to &#163;22,195 for the all-wheel-drive auto 
version.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
But with Nissan already sold out and now making extra to meet demand, there 
are clearly plenty of Juke buyers wanting the Nismo experience.
</p>
<p></p>
<h4>
ROAD TEST: QASHQAI 360
</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>
FAMILY car buyers invariably have to compromise.
</p>
<p>
They want a vehicle to be fashionable and look good &#8211; but what they need is a 
car that is practical to meet the demands of a young family.
</p>
<p>
What Nissan delivered with the original Qashqai was a no-compromise car that 
didn&#8217;t look like a hatchback &#8211; it was more interesting, more roomy &#8211; but 
which cost a similar price. Bingo.
</p>
<p>
It even came with the option of four-wheel drive for families in rural areas 
and provided the option of seven seats in the +2 version.
</p>
<p>
But Nissan have not sat back and basked in the Qashqai&#8217;s big sales.
</p>
<p>
A minor facelift in 2011 smartened up the headlights and grille to give even 
more visual appeal and now they&#8217;ve brought out a 360 version to continue the 
momentum.
</p>
<p>
But the attraction of the Qashqai 360 remains the same basic formula &#8211; big on 
space and practicality, with ultra-economical engines and that high-up 
seating position that mum, dad and the kids like.
</p>
<p>
Qashqais also come equipped with Bluetooth, satnav, air con, glove box cooler 
and 360&#176; monitor that gives you a screen view all around the car &#8211; perfect 
for parking.
</p>
<p>
I tested the 1.6litre diesel &#8211; the best engine &#8211; which delivers a useful mix 
of reasonable performance and the now-vital fuel economy figure of just over 
60mpg. And it&#8217;s tax-friendly at 119g CO2 emissions.
</p>
<p>
There are also 1.5 and 2litre turbo diesels, plus a 1.6litre turbo petrol.
</p>
<p>
The Qashqai&#8217;s handling is very similar to a hatchback, though not quite as 
agile on cornering. But it&#8217;s still a relaxing and comfortable drive.
</p>
<p>
Prices for the Qashqai Visia 1.6 petrol are from &#163;16,595 &#8211; haggle and you&#8217;ll 
get a few hundred off &#8211; with the 360 starting at &#163;19,945 and going up to 
&#163;27,095 for the seven-seat 4x4 +2 model.

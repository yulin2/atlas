The '''seventh and final''' season of the television series '''''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''''' premiered on September 24, 2002 on [[UPN]] and concluded its 22-episode season and its television run on May 20, 2003. It maintained its previous timeslot, airing Tuesdays at 8:00&nbsp;pm ET.

== Plot ==
Season seven deals with the [[Potential Slayers]], normal girls around the world who are candidates to succeed the Slayer upon her death.

It is revealed that [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]]'s resurrection caused an instability which allows The [[First Evil]], a spiritual entity that Buffy encountered in the third season, to begin tipping the balance between good and evil.  It has inactive Potential Slayers hunted and killed by [[Caleb (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Caleb]], a sinister and misogynistic preacher turned serial killer who heads a cult called [[Bringers of the First Evil|Bringers]], who worship The First as a god.  Inside the Hellmouth it raises an army of [[Turok-Han]], an ancient and powerful sub species of vampire.  Caleb destroys the [[Watchers' Council]].

[[Dawn Summers|Dawn]] begins her sophomore year at high school.  Buffy gets a job at the rebuilt [[Sunnydale High]], where she meets the new principal, [[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Robin Wood]], vampire hunter and son of deceased Slayer [[Nikki Wood]]. Buffy also reunites with Willow, who with help got over her emotional rampage in the previous season, and Spike, who earned his soul back but is temporarily driven mad by regret. 

[[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] begins to emotionally heal from [[Tara Maclay|Tara]]'s death and finds solace with a Potential Slayer named [[Kennedy (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kennedy]]. They immediately start going out before Kennedy can fully understand Willow. Their relationship is strained when Willow drains a significant portion of her life force to reopen a portal for Buffy, but they soon reconcile. 

[[Andrew Wells]] and [[Jonathan Levinson]] return to Sunnydale after The First convinces them to help open the [[Seal of Danzalthar]]. In the process, Levinson is killed. Andrew is captured by the Scoobies, who show resentment to him. Andrew soon becomes comic relief until he attempts to make a documentary on the Scoobies, but Buffy scolds him into seeing the seriousness of their situation.  Andrew then becomes a committed ally of the Scoobies. 

[[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] and [[Xander Harris|Xander]] break up for good after a demon named [[Halfrek]] gets her to kill a group of frat boys. Buffy and Anya fight while Willow summons [[D'Hoffryn]], who questions Anya. Anya requests that her latest vengeance be reversed. Halfrek is killed and Anya is turned human once more.

[[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] is driven mad by The First, and soon it also gains control of him for a time. The First also reveals that Spike killed Robin Wood's mother, sparking a vendetta. Robin makes an attempt on Spike's life. Ironically, this attack frees Spike from his insanity and, regaining his clarity, Spike beats Robin. Buffy finds the injured Robin in his garage and angrily shuns him for attacking Spike. Buffy finds out that Giles was part of the scheme, and becomes angry at him, but they soon make peace.

Willow helps track the Potentials in Sunnydale and a number of them, brought by [[Rupert Giles|Giles]], take refuge in Buffy's house. Dawn at first believes herself to be a Potential, but becomes disappointed when she finds that is not the case. Xander cheers her up saying she's anything but ordinary. The now human Anya also joins them; while she and Xander still love each other, they don't get back together. 

A reformed [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] returns to Sunnydale to help fight The First. When Buffy leads the Potentials to attack Caleb and his allies, several are killed and Xander loses an eye in the fight. The Scoobies and the Potentials begin to question Buffy's leadership skill. They mutiny against her, led by Faith. Xander takes Dawn out of Sunnydale. Spike, however, stays loyal to Buffy and informs her that he has learned of an ancient [[Battle axe|weapon]], known as the Scythe, that was designed for the Slayer. While Buffy fights Caleb and finds the Scythe, Faith leads the Potentials on a mission, only to find they've been tricked as a time bomb explodes. Following the explosion, several Turok-Han attack the survivors. Buffy saves the lives of the remaining Potential Slayers and reconciles with Faith. 

As the Hellmouth becomes more active, nearly all human and supernatural creatures flee Sunnydale. Buffy and her allies stay behind in an effort to defeat The First. Robin Wood returns to join this cause and even accepts Spike.

In the series finale, Dawn returns to help fight the First. Angel leaves Los Angeles and comes to Sunnydale with an amulet, which Buffy gives to Spike. Buffy finally kills Caleb by cutting him in half with the scythe. While Caleb is dead, they make their move to thwart The First's plans once and for all. The Potentials descend into the Hellmouth to fight an army of Turok-Han, while the other Scoobies hold off the few Turok-Han that escape into the halls of Sunnydale High. Willow uses a spell that activates all the Potential Slayers, granting them some Slayer powers. Anya is killed in the fight, along with some of the new Slayers. Fearing she is done for, The First returns to taunt Buffy, saying her fight is in vain. Refusing to let the world be destroyed, Buffy and her allies dig deep and begin to gain the upper hand. Spike's amulet channels the power of the sun and kills all of the Turok-Han in the Hellmouth, but Spike himself is also consumed and he sacrifices himself to defeat the enemy. Buffy tells Spike she loves him; he tells her to run. The Hellmouth collapses, and the resulting crater swallows all of Sunnydale.  The survivors of the battle escape on a school bus, which Buffy catches up to after saying goodbye to Spike.

In the last scene of the series, the survivors gather on the rim of Sunnydale's crater. The Scoobies and new Slayers tend to the wounded. Xander mourns Anya's death and is consoled by Andrew. Dawn asks what their next move is and Buffy smiles.

=== Crossovers with ''Angel'' ===
The seventh and final season of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' coincided with the [[Angel (season 4)|fourth season]] of ''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]''. This was the final year in which both shows were on television together.

In "[[Lies My Parents Told Me]]", [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]) receives a call from [[Winifred Burkle|Fred]]. She leaves immediately and goes to L.A. without telling why. Willow appears in the ''Angel'' episode "[[Orpheus (Angel)|Orpheus]]" to re-ensoul [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] ([[David Boreanaz]]) as she previously did before in "[[Becoming (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Becoming]]". After successfully re-ensouling Angel, she brings [[Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Faith]] ([[Eliza Dushku]]) back with her to Sunnydale to help in the fight against [[First Evil|The First Evil]].

In the ''Angel'' season four finale, "[[Home (Angel)|Home]]", Angel receives an amulet from [[Wolfram & Hart]] which is important to the final battle in Sunnydale. Angel goes to Sunnydale in the penultimate episode "[[End of Days (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|End of Days]]" and also appears in the series finale "[[Chosen (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Chosen]]". Angel gives Buffy the amulet (which is later worn by [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] in the final battle) and offers his help, but Buffy declines as she needs him to be the second front if they fail. Buffy and Angel share one final moment in a graveyard where they discuss a possible future.

In the fifth and final season of ''Angel'', Spike is resurrected (after his death in "Chosen") by the magical amulet. Spike becomes a main character in the final season. [[Harmony Kendall]] ([[Mercedes McNab]]) also becomes a main character in the final season. ''Buffy'' recurring character [[Andrew Wells]] ([[Tom Lenk]]) appears in two episodes ("[[Damage (Angel)|Damage]]" and "[[The Girl in Question]]") in the final season of ''Angel'', revealed to be a [[Watcher (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Watcher]]-in-training. Andrew states in "Damage" that [[Xander Harris|Xander]] is in Africa, Willow and [[Kennedy (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kennedy]] are in Brazil, Buffy and [[Dawn Summers|Dawn]] are in Rome, and everyone else is in England.

== Reception ==
The series received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series for "[[Chosen (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Chosen]]". While, "Chosen" won for Outstanding Visual Effects in a Television Series at the [[Visual Effects Society|Visual Effects Society Awards]].

 |ShortSummary=Fran returns from a holiday in [[Cornwall]] to find Bernard living amongst mouldy books and dead [[badger]]s and Manny working next door at the extremely glossy Goliath Books following an incident involving Manny's hand and a sandwich toaster, where he is decidedly out of place amongst creepy manager Evan and his army of hyper-efficient pastel-shirted followers. Armed with only a "duty to do" card (a card that elicits a "doo-ti-too-doo" sound when inserted into the corresponding slot on a computer) and an endless supply of muffins, Manny manages to resist Fran's rather self-serving attempts to drag him back to Bernard so that she has somewhere to hang out. Bernard's physical condition deteriorates rapidly without Manny's care ("I feel like I've been beaten up, underwater"), but Manny is soon questioning his choice of career as Evan demands an unthinkable sacrifice.

Meanwhile, Fran's hen party is a disaster: the booze starts flowing, and a game of truth stirs up tears and recriminations.

Meanwhile, Bernard's landlord has died and a small cat now owns the building. Driven to destroy the cat's burgeoning real-estate empire, he attempts to persuade an animal-loving pest exterminator to turn kitty hitman.

 |ShortSummary=On a slow Friday night, Manny suggests that the gang go to a party which will be attended by Rowena, a girl he likes. Instantly jealous, Bernard overcomes his natural reluctance with curiosity to see what kind of "so-called person" could find Manny attractive. Manny arms himself with an array of items to strategically leave about the house to give him an excuse to call her, and Fran checks her perfect new hairstyle. They return much later armed with a bizarre selection of alcohol, messed-up hair, and a desire to dance badly. An excess of [[beetroot]] [[liqueur]] gives Manny the courage to confront Bernard regarding his disdain for Manny's affection for Rowena — this brings forth a shocking revelation from Bernard, which is soon tarnished as Fran tells Manny the truth about Bernard.

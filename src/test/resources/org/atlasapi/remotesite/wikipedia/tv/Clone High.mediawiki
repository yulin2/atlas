'''''Clone High'''''  (occasionally referred to in the U.S. as '''''Clone High U.S.A.''''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]]-[[United States|American]] adult [[List of animated television series|animated television series]] that aired for one season (November&nbsp;2002&nbsp;– April&nbsp;2003) on [[MTV]] and [[Teletoon (Canadian TV channel)|Teletoon]].<ref>{{cite news | title=''Clone High'' on hiatus! No school for Scudworth! | date=2003-03-17 | publisher=CloneHighUSA.com | url=http://www.clonehighusa.com/news/ARTICLES/Article_HTMLs/article_8_hiatus.htm | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030603210505/http://clonehighusa.com/news/ARTICLES/Article_HTMLs/article_8_hiatus.htm | archivedate=2003-06-03 }}</ref>

The series had run in its entirety in Canada on Teletoon before premiering in the United States on MTV. The last five episodes were never broadcast in the United States. The ''Clone High'' theme song was written by [[Liam Lynch (musician)|Liam Lynch]] and performed by [[alternative rock]] band [[Abandoned Pools]], who also provided much of the series' background music.

==Synopsis==
''Clone High'' is set in a [[high school]] that is secretly being run as an elaborate military experiment orchestrated by a [[Federal government of the United States|government office]] called the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures. The school is entirely populated by [[cloning|clones]] of famous historical figures that have been created and raised with the intent of having their various strengths and abilities harnessed by the [[United States military]]. The [[school principal|principal]] of the high school, Cinnamon J. Scudworth, has his own plans for the clones, and secretly tries to undermine the wishes of the Board (Scudworth wants to use the clones to create a clone-themed amusement park, dubbed "Cloney Island", a decidedly less evil intention than that of the Board). He is assisted by his [[robot]] butler/[[School principal|vice principal]]/[[dehumidifier]], Mr. Butlertron (a parody of ''[[Mr. Belvedere]]''), who is programmed to call everyone "Wesley" and speak in two distinct intonations.

The main protagonists of ''Clone High'' are the clones of [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Joan of Arc]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Much of the plot of the show revolves around the attempts of Abe to woo the vain and promiscuous clone of [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Cleopatra]], while being oblivious to the fact that his friend Joan of Arc is attracted to him. Meanwhile, [[John F. Kennedy]]'s clone (referred to as "JFK"), a macho, narcissistic womanizer, is also attempting to win over Cleopatra and has a long-standing rivalry with Abe.  Gandhi acts in many of the episodes as the comic relief.  Also on a few occasions, the characters that we see learn most of "Life's Lessons" the hard way.

===Themes and style===
[[File:Thegrassyknollclonehigh.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The [[Grassy Knoll]], a reference to the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|JFK assassination]] [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theory]] about a second shooter, dubbed "[[Dealey Plaza#The "grassy knoll"|The Man on the Grassy Knoll]]". Notice the flag at half mast and JFK leaning over the car.]]
Much of the humor in the show comes from the large contrast between the personality of the clones and the actual values and legacy of the historical figures they are descended from. For instance, Gandhi is portrayed as a hyperactive jerk-with-a-heart-of-gold whose biggest dream is to be accepted by those around him, in contrast to his historical legacy of calm nonviolence. Abe Lincoln is similarly portrayed as weak and indecisive, completely lacking the resolve of the [[President of the United States|President]] whose DNA he shares. All of the clones are also given mis-matched [[foster parent]]s who have little in common with them. Gandhi's parents are a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] couple, while JFK is raised by a [[homosexuality|homosexual]], [[interracial couple]]; Joan's "foster grandpa" is an elderly blind musician similar to [[Ray Charles]] named Toots, a parody of the stereotypical [[wise old man]] role (and the [[magical negro]] role) found in many teen shows, and who begins many of his declarative sentences with the words, "Now, I may be blind, but I can see..." followed by a wise-sounding observation that has little or nothing to do with anything.

The show also includes humor based on the historical figures themselves. For example, the diner the clones frequent is called The Grassy Knoll, a reference to the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|JFK assassination]] [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy theory]] about a second shooter, dubbed "[[Grassy knoll|The Man on the Grassy Knoll]]". Other references seen are the flag at The Grassy Knoll being permanently at [[half mast]] and the car on the roof of the diner containing the original JFK's body leaning over the edge. There are pictures of assassinations hanging on the walls of the restaurant, such as the famous [[:Image:The Assassination of President Lincoln - Currier and Ives.png|Currier and Ives print]] of the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln assassination]] (though this version is in color and considerably more graphic than the original print). The genetic ancestors of all of the five main clones died of similarly irregular causes: three assassinations, one execution and one suicide. Other historical figure-based humor includes offhand coincidental remarks to other students, such as Abe mentioning that the clone of [[Napoleon]] is so annoying because of "[[Napoleon complex|some kind of complex]]", or Gandhi telling [[Catherine the Great]] to "[[Legends of Catherine the Great|get off her high horse]]".

The show is also a [[parody]] of "issue" episodes of high-school themed comedies; in fact, almost every episode opens with a voice-over parodying the "[[very special episode]]s" of TV shows. Episodes center on various social issues, including Gandhi being shunned by his school for having [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADD]] (because of misinformation about the disorder), parodying shows which tackle [[AIDS]] awareness (it even included a special guest celebrity who tries to educate the students). Other episodes tackle [[recreational drug use|drugs]] (smoking raisins), the environment, and underage drinking in a similarly ridiculous fashion. In a clear sign that it is parodying the high school genre, it even ends at [[prom]]: a stereotypical "high school show" ending. Even the prom is a joke however, as we learn it is only the Winter Prom.

There was a [[running gag]] that creators Phil Lord and Christopher Miller wanted to include in the show "where Clone High – being an exaggeration of typical high schools in teen dramas – would have many proms throughout the year".{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Planned proms included "an Early Winter Prom, a Late Winter/Early Spring Prom, a Mid-Semester Prom, a Post-Prom Clean Up Prom, etc".{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The only surviving references to this joke are the Homecoming Prom in episode 6, "Homecoming: A Shot in D'Arc", and the winter prom in episode 13, "Changes: The Big Prom: The Sex Romp: The Season Finale".<ref name="pundog6">{{cite web | author=Pava, Adam | title=Episode Six: 'Homecoming: A Shot in the D'Arc' Notes | work=CloneHighUSA.com | url=http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/episode_notes/episode_six.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030427125949/http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/episode_notes/episode_six.html | archivedate=2003-04-27}}</ref> Another reference to the gag was deleted from episode 8, "A Room of One's Clone: Pie of the Storm".<ref name="pundog6"/>

==Production==
The series was originally developed in 2000 and was titled ''Clone High School, USA!'' and the production was overseen by [[Touchstone Television]]. It was originally pitched to the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] but was rejected and it was later picked by MTV in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clonehighusa.com/backstage/episode_notes/episode_seven.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040215201829/http://clonehighusa.com/backstage/episode_notes/episode_seven.html|archivedate=2004-02-15|title=CloneHighUSA.com|publisher=web.archive.org|date=2004-02-25|accessdate=2011-07-12}}</ref> All the original character designs were much different from what they would become even though the characters kept the same physical attibrutes and appearance.

The show uses the process of [[limited animation]] and has a flat and very stylized appearance that resembles the animation used in the last generation of [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons (such as ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Two Stupid Dogs]]'', ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' and ''[[Samurai Jack]]'', the last is the show which Lord and Miller admire). The characters and backgrounds are [[traditional animation|traditionally drawn]] but the frames and cels are frequently recycled. The reason for the usage of this animation was explained by the co-creator Chris Miller, "We like the snappy pose-to-pose animation, more for reasons of comic timing than anything else, things that aren't expected are funnier: If an anvil's going to fall on your head, it had better not take more than three seconds. That's why we like the quick pose-to-pose stuff. For scenes with more emotional content, the characters move a little slower and more fluidly." and Phil Lord adds, "But we never want the viewer to be paying attention to the animation, because it's there to serve the jokes and the story, we strip out extraneous movements, because we don't want to draw your eye to anything that's not part of a joke."  Also, Each episode produced has the budget of approximately $750,000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/17/entertainment/et-solomon17|title=Freshman animators|publisher=articles. latimes.com|date=2003-27-2|accessdate=2011-27-7|first=Charles|last=Solomon}}</ref> Gandhi is the most animated character on the show; he requires twice as many story-board poses as any other character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/funfacts/fun_facts.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080602070504/http://www.clonehighusa.com/backstage/funfacts/fun_facts.html|archivedate=2008-06-02|title=Clone High Fun Facts|publisher=archive.org|accessdate=2011-28-7}}</ref>

The series was produced by [[Bill Lawrence (TV producer)|Bill Lawrence]], who also produced ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', ''[[Spin City]]'' and currently ''[[Cougar Town]]''. Many of ''Scrubs'' alumni provide voices of several characters in ''Clone High'', such as [[Zach Braff]], [[Donald Faison]], [[Sarah Chalke]], [[John C. McGinley]], [[Neil Flynn]] and [[Christa Miller]].

Also, there is an image of a [[dolphin]] hidden in almost every episode. In the episode "Raisin the Stakes," there were countless hidden messages that appear to be a parody of [[subliminal messaging]].

==Broadcast==
''Clone High'' was shown seen on Canadian television in 2001 and 2002 before it debuted on [[MTV]] in the United States on January 20, 2003.<ref>Erickson, 2005. p.204</ref><ref name="Hal205">Erickson, 2005. p.205</ref> ''Clone High'' was removed from its Prime Time rotation before all 13 episodes had been shown due to mediocre ratings.<ref name="Hal205" />

==Soundtrack==
The previous animated MTV series ''[[Daria]]'' and ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' had used then-current [[popular music]] as a soundtrack. But in contrast, Clone High featured a wide variety of music, usually exclusive to [[alternative rock]], [[indie rock]], [[punk rock]], [[pop rock]], [[metalcore]], from mostly unknown and [[underground music|underground]] bands and musicians, a previous MTV animated series ''[[Undergrads]]'' had also done this. Of these include [[Alkaline Trio]], [[Ritalin (band)|Ritalin]], [[Catch 22 (band)|Catch 22]], [[Ilya (band)|Ilya]], The Gentleman, Drex, [[Taking Back Sunday]], [[The Stereo]], Jo Davidson, [[Saves the Day]], [[Hot Rod Circuit]], [[Thursday (band)|Thursday]],  Helicopter Helicopter, [[American Football (band)|American Football]], [[Dashboard Confessional]], [[Elf Power]], [[Abandoned Pools]], [[The Get Up Kids]], [[Mink Lungs]], [[Mates of State]], [[Snapcase]], [[The Mooney Suzuki]], [[Jon DeRosa]], [[Ephemera (band)|Ephemera]], Jinnrall, [[Avoid One Thing]], DJ Cellulitis, DJ Piccolo, [[Whippersnapper (band)|Whippersnapper]], [[Matt Pond PA]], Mad City and [[Ron "Bumblefoot" Thal|Bumblefoot]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/clone_high/ |title=MTV.com - Onair - Clone High |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2003-01-19 |accessdate=2010-12-06 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030119090212/www.mtv.com/onair/clone_high/ |archivedate=2003-01-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clonehighusa.com/music/music_by_episode.html|title=CloneHighUSA.com|publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2003-01-04 |accessdate=2011-07-03 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030409053346/www.clonehighusa.com/music/music_by_episode.html |archivedate=2003-04-09}}</ref> The series other background music and original score would be performed by the Abandoned Pools.

==Reception==
Because of the series' early cancellation in 2003, it quickly fell into obscurity, especially in the United States. However, it has garnered a large fanbase through the Internet and still reruns on [[Teletoon (Canada)|Teletoon]]'s ''[[Teletoon at Night]]'' block and formerly on [[MTV2 (Canada)|Razer]] in Canada.

Heather Marulli of the website ''[[Television Without Pity]]'', called the series "a mini-masterpiece of the animated genre; an opus to the primetime cartoon"<ref>{{cite web|last=Marulli |first=Heather| title=Tonight, On A Very Special Clone High... | url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/brilliantbutcancelled/2009/12/tonight-on-a-very-special-clon.php|publisher=televisionwithoutpity.com |accessdate=2009-12-01}}</ref>

David Bianculli of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', wrote that "(Clone High) in a year of variations and ripoffs of established themes and genres, it's a true original.
